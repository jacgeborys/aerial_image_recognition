# Dataset for training of YOLO with aerial photo car detection #

This is dataset used for training YOLOv3 to find all cars in aerial photos. See https://youtu.be/JVatGRW2j7E for example.

For labeling https://github.com/Cartucho/yolo-boundingbox-labeler-GUI was used (be sure that you have OpenCV with OpenGL support enabled before use it!).
